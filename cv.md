3. I am a quick learner and a teamworker. I do not hesitate to ask questions and try different approaches in development. Listening to other people's opinions, discussing controversial issues and trying to find a compromise in every conflict situation are some of my top priorities in a working environment. I strive to be the kind of person to whom people come for help. I always try to show the best result I can, without half-measures.

   - Sass
